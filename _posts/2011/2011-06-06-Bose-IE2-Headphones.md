A couple months ago, I found myself longing for a new set of headphones. I have a pair of Sennheiser headphones which are rather large but sound great and have a boom microphone. As I realized, those don't travel very well and I have recently started to work more onsite and in remote locations.

So the search began for new set of quality headphones. I need something compact and with a built in microphone for VoIP calls (Skype, Communicator, etc.)

I thought of using my apple ear buds but the sound quality is just not very good. Eventually I took a look at the [Bose IE2 in-ear headphones](http://www.amazon.com/Bose-326223-0030-Bose%C2%AEMIE2i-mobile-headset/dp/B0043WCH66/ref=pd_cp_e_1). At first I was a little skeptical with the design. Take a look at those large pieces of silicone that you need to shove into your ears. Can't be comfortable right?

Wrong. After buying them I realized that the fit could not be better. I wear these things sometimes for 8 hours straight without any discomfort. Sometimes I even get up from my desk and forget that I have them on.

I am a big fan. It's Bose, so the sound quality is great. I don't think the fit could be any better. The microphone works great on the PC or connect to my mobile phone.

One other note, if you are thinking of using this for VoIP with your PC/MAC, look into the headset adapter buddy. This adapter let's you connect a conventional mobile phone headset into you PC or MAC with separate jacks for both the output sound and microphone.
