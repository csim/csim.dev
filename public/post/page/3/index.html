      Ever since I can remember I have been an addict. Over the years my addictions have come and gone. But one thing has always remained: I have an addictive personality. Luckily for me all my addictions have been mostly productive.
It started when I got my first computer, the Commodore 64. At the age of 10 I got the C64 for Christmas and soon after I learned the BASIC programming language so that I could study my Spanish vocabulary words.

      Bit of a rant here. I received this message today Microsoft.
Do you think the average developer knows that &ldquo;Windows 8 GA&rdquo; means?
GA stands for &ldquo;Generally Availability&rdquo;. Put yourself in the position of the Microsoft marketer who composed this message. Why on Earth won&rsquo;t you just write out the words instead of using the abbreviation?
This doesn&rsquo;t need to be a secret handshake. Granted, if you Google it on bing, you&rsquo;ll get an answer fairly quickly.

      I got my hands on a copy of Windows 8 through MSDN about a month ago and installed it immediately. I&rsquo;ve used it since then as my daily working machine on my main laptop.
First of all the speed of Windows 8 is apparent from the start. Everything feels faster - boot time, application launch, etc. I am working on a 3 year old Lenovo W500 and I can honestly say that Windows 8 has extended its life by at least 6 months.

      Never Forget  The attacks resulted in the death of 2,996 people, including the 19 hijackers and 2,977 victims. The victims included 246 on the four planes (from which there were no survivors), 2,606 in New York City in the towers and on the ground, and 125 at the Pentagon. Nearly all of the victims were civilians; 55 military personnel were among those killed at the Pentagon.

      My Favorite Features: Entity Framework Code First and ASP.NET Web API Great overview of the EF5 release with summary and coding samples.
Jason Zander:
 New features in Entity Framework 5:
 Enum support is a long awaited feature for EF and allows you to have enum properties in your domain classes. EF5 makes enum support available in the EF Designer and Code First. Table-valued functions in an existing database can now be included in models that are created using the EF Designer.

      Whether you know it or not, you are training everyone you interact with each day. When you answer that email at midnight or take that call at 8PM, you are sending a message. The message is that you work any time and you are willing to sacrifice your personal life for the job.
In typical over-achiever fashion, you are reacting to each request without regard for your personal well-being. After following this pattern for years, I have realized that I need to stop the vicious cycle.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I ran into an interesting problem with Google app engine. It seems that the memcache time limit is enforced differently on the development server versus the production servers.
The documentation says that the time limit for a memcache key is 30 days. The behavior that I have observed is that if you set a memcache key to timeout at 30 days, the development server (on windows) will happily persist the data as expected.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Over the past few years I have seen many developers struggle with a growing dilemma, do I devote my time to platform development?
When I say &ldquo;platform development&rdquo; I mean building application on products such as Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft CRM. The IT world is rapidly moving toward standardizing on platforms such as these. They offer lower IT costs, standardized infrastructure and overall lower cost of ownership. It makes sense from a business perspective, but what do you do as a developer?
