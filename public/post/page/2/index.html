      I&rsquo;m not a long-term planner. I&rsquo;ve never made a &ldquo;5 year plan&rdquo; or thought about where I want to be 10 years from now. I simply look at what my options are and make a decision about what to do next.
I only learned to code because my dad needed a problem solved. He ran a consulting business where he needed to perform regular equipment maintenance. It was 1996 and the web was new.

      Over the past year or so, my career has taken a turn toward what I would call &ldquo;pure consulting&rdquo; or put more plainly, &ldquo;giving people my opinion&rdquo;. During this time I really hadn&rsquo;t written any code to speak of, minus some small side projects. There just wasn&rsquo;t a need for it and frankly I had my hands full.
All that changed when I started a new project and took ownership of a large chunk of functionality.

      Learning new technologies and techniques is a part of life for any software developer. Programming is a quest for knowledge and understanding which lasts your entire lifetime. No other profession has a more dynamic working environment. Tools change and evolve on a daily basis it seems. Learning is incumbent on all developers. Darwin&rsquo;s law applies, adapt or perish.
Luckily most of us are used to this environment and thrive on the constantly changing landscape.

        Using IE10 with Dynamics CRM Online

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      It appears that Dynamics CRM Online does not play well with Internet Explorer 10. In fact, it downright does not work with IE10. Many of the web dialogs are unusable and when you receive an error, the error dialog exhibits bazaar behavior.
This is an absolute tragedy. Windows 8 launched 3 weeks ago with IE10 included and the Dynamics product team was not prepared. The user experience on a windows 8 machine for Dynamics CRM is basically unusable.

      There are times when I have witness (and participated in) arguments about trade-offs between scope and effort. Sometimes developers tend to push back fairly hard with the perception is that the effort is too high for a particular feature change.
Coders can become downright defensive when you are talking about changing the fundamentals of an application. After all, this is their baby and someone just through it out with the bathwater.

      One of the best things that you can do as a developer is to be equal parts lazy and smart. This is an art that can be mastered to great effect. I don&rsquo;t mean that you should abandon your passion for programming or stop being focused and goal driven. I mean that you should avoid work that is not absolutely necessary. To do that you need to be both lazy and smart in equal parts.

      It&rsquo;s funny, I put off writing this post for over a week. That might make me a hypocrite but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the truth is less important. Procrastination is the enemy.
If you want to get something done, start immediately and fail often.
There are a million reasons not to start right away. Maybe you won&rsquo;t be any good at it, or you have more important things to do. Maybe you are just plain scared of judgment from your peers.

      You have been working here for about 3 years. Life is good. You come in as late as you like and leave late because the work is challenging and rewarding. No one is watching over your shoulder, most days you sling code until your mind goes numb. At any moment a nerf gun war can break out in the office. When Halo 3 was released, all work stopped and there was an all-nighter in the game room.

        Tech Interview Question: The Clock Problem

      &ldquo;The Clock Problem&rdquo; is an interview question that I have been using for a few years. I first learned about it when I was being interviewed. I have now adopted it as my first line of defense against imposters. :)
It&rsquo;s a simple problem that can be used to determine a candidate&rsquo;s capacity for analytical problem solving. The beauty is that the problem has a simple and elegant solution which can be found in less than 10 minutes.

      In my daily work, I lead teams that build software. These are &ldquo;line of business&rdquo; or &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; software systems. I come into contact with a lot of developers, all with differing backgrounds, experience levels and personalities. I see the good and the bad. Pride generally stands out as the most accurate quality indicator of the individual developer.
Having pride in your work makes you want to improve. If you are mindful of the effects that your work has on others, that can only lead to a better career path.
