      I ran into an interesting situation when saving dated to MongoDB using the Mongo .Net driver (version 2.0).
When saving a date with unspecified kind, the driver converts the date to a universal datetime. It appears that the driver will assume that a DateTime object with an unspecified kind is a local time, and convert it to universal time (UTC) before committing it to the database.
In my particular case, my origin date was UTC and was read from SQL server.

      Data migration can sink your project. It lurks around the edges of your estimation model, hiding deep dark secrets that will only be uncovered at the very end of the project. Nothing could be worse. Discovering that you need to increase the migration schedule 5 fold at the 11th hour can not only derail your project but if it happens too often it might derail your career.
I have learned a few lesson on this topic:

This is especially helpful when viewing a page from a mobile device or table. You can easily deduce which size group maps to a particular device in each orientation.

Play around with AutoRepeatDelay and AutoRepeatRate, these are the settings that work for me.
Don&rsquo;t set the AutoRepeatDelay too fast, it will make it so that when you type letters they are repeated immediately.

One very handy shortcut is the ability to launch the sublime text editor and open the current directory as a project. Or alternately passing in a file to edit.
Once this function is in your powershell profile, just type &ldquo;edit&rdquo; at the command prompt and sublime will open the current folder.

Luckily most of us are used to this environment and thrive on the constantly changing landscape.

      There are times when I have witness (and participated in) arguments about trade-offs between scope and effort. Sometimes developers tend to push back fairly hard with the perception is that the effort is too high for a particular feature change.
Coders can become downright defensive when you are talking about changing the fundamentals of an application. After all, this is their baby and someone just through it out with the bathwater.

If you want to get something done, start immediately and fail often.
There are a million reasons not to start right away. Maybe you won&rsquo;t be any good at it, or you have more important things to do. Maybe you are just plain scared of judgment from your peers.

The documentation says that the time limit for a memcache key is 30 days. The behavior that I have observed is that if you set a memcache key to timeout at 30 days, the development server (on windows) will happily persist the data as expected.

      Data caching is a core concept in the web dominated world that we live in. The premise is that we should not have to go back to retrieve data from a data store for every single web request when the data is unchanged, thereby sharing data across web requests. This offers huge performance advantages because all latency related to data fetching, query processing and transmission is eliminated for requests that use the same data.

      When creating custom controls it is often must easier to create a control using the &ldquo;User Control&rdquo; development model instead of the &ldquo;Server Control&rdquo; model. Server controls generally have a more &ldquo;low level&rdquo; feel and dictate that the developer build the control&rsquo;s rendering from scratch. Either by building a control tree or by constructing the rendered output in code.
Alternatively user controls have nice separation of code and presentation by virtue of having a markup file (.

      As SharePoint becomes more prevalent in the custom application development realm, there has been some friction and malcontent expressed in relation to deployment processes, team development methods and application upgrade paths. I believe that Microsoft has fallen short on providing the tools necessary to promote and support custom application development on the SharePoint platform.
In my opinion, the SharePoint platform should not limit nor impede my ability as a custom application developer to deliver solutions that follow the same deployment principals as any other custom asp.
