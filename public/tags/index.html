      I ran into an interesting problem with Google app engine. It seems that the memcache time limit is enforced differently on the development server versus the production servers.
The documentation says that the time limit for a memcache key is 30 days. The behavior that I have observed is that if you set a memcache key to timeout at 30 days, the development server (on windows) will happily persist the data as expected.

      Google App engine is in the process of changing it&rsquo;s pricing model. At present this new pricing model goes into effect on December 1, 2011. There has been quite an uproar among App engine developers. In some cases the new billing model raises monthly costs by more than 300%. This has cause quite a reaction among the community and the backlash is very real
What is changing? The primary change is that Google is moving from a model where you are charged by CPU time to a model where you are charged by &ldquo;instance time&rdquo;.

Play around with AutoRepeatDelay and AutoRepeatRate, these are the settings that work for me.
Don&rsquo;t set the AutoRepeatDelay too fast, it will make it so that when you type letters they are repeated immediately.

      Data migration can sink your project. It lurks around the edges of your estimation model, hiding deep dark secrets that will only be uncovered at the very end of the project. Nothing could be worse. Discovering that you need to increase the migration schedule 5 fold at the 11th hour can not only derail your project but if it happens too often it might derail your career.
I have learned a few lesson on this topic:

We are very much invested in the success of the project and the success of the business as a whole.

Here&rsquo;s a few tips that I think might help.
Ask a lot of questions.

If you want to get something done, start immediately and fail often.
There are a million reasons not to start right away. Maybe you won&rsquo;t be any good at it, or you have more important things to do. Maybe you are just plain scared of judgment from your peers.

      It turns out that my guitar taught me a valuable lesson. Somehow in this crazy house that I live in, ago a week ago, my guitar spontaneously migrated out of my office. One of the kids moved it to the upstairs bonus room without my knowledge. I usually keep my acoustic guitar right next to my work desk. It sits there 99 percent of the time. Occasionally when the mode strikes, I pick it up and strum a tune.

Don&rsquo;t set the AutoRepeatDelay too fast, it will make it so that when you type letters they are repeated immediately.

The documentation says that the time limit for a memcache key is 30 days. The behavior that I have observed is that if you set a memcache key to timeout at 30 days, the development server (on windows) will happily persist the data as expected.

      Most people think of programmers as the guys guzzling mountain dew in a dark room where pizza slides under the door at around 6PM and a feature is built by 2AM. Although this is can be the case (we&rsquo;ve all been there), I have found that most of the people that I look up to are not at all like this. More often than not people who have influenced me over the years are people that show a genuine passion for software but also have massive creative energy and a social team mentality to boot.

      Data caching is a core concept in the web dominated world that we live in. The premise is that we should not have to go back to retrieve data from a data store for every single web request when the data is unchanged, thereby sharing data across web requests. This offers huge performance advantages because all latency related to data fetching, query processing and transmission is eliminated for requests that use the same data.

 It gets out of your way. As the name indicates, the browser is not in your way at all. The content is front and center and the browser is an afterthought.

      Spotify launched in the U.S. on July 14th. Given the hoopla around the service I decided to give it a try. Spotify is a music service that allows users to stream or download music, includes social integration and has support for offline listening. Many people have raved about the service in Europe and there has been a constant chorus for an american launch.

      It is possible to manipulate the web.config file globally by using a little known feature in SharePoint that allows developers to describe a set of changes by using an XML customization file. In fact, both SharePoint and MOSS use this mechanism to publish web.config changes when a web application is created.

      You are probably familiar with the fact that SharePoint now has the capability to host site with anonymous access turned on.

When an item does not inherit permissions, it is not possible to enable anonymous access on that item. Note the document library permission settings menu:
Here&rsquo;s the same menu for an item which is not inheriting permissions from the parent library:

Do you think the average developer knows that &ldquo;Windows 8 GA&rdquo; means?
GA stands for &ldquo;Generally Availability&rdquo;. Put yourself in the position of the Microsoft marketer who composed this message. Why on Earth won&rsquo;t you just write out the words instead of using the abbreviation?
This doesn&rsquo;t need to be a secret handshake. Granted, if you Google it on bing, you&rsquo;ll get an answer fairly quickly.

First of all the speed of Windows 8 is apparent from the start. Everything feels faster - boot time, application launch, etc. I am working on a 3 year old Lenovo W500 and I can honestly say that Windows 8 has extended its life by at least 6 months.
